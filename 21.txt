Dont go far off not even for a day because  
because  I dont know how to say it a day is long 
and I will be waiting for you as in an empty station 
when the trains are parked off somewhere else asleep 

Dont leave me even for an hour because 
then the little drops of anguish will all run together 
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift 
into me choking my lost heart 

Oh may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach 
may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance 
Dont leave me for a second my dearest 

because in that moment youll have gone so far 
Ill wander mazily over all the earth asking 
Will you come back Will you leave me here dying
