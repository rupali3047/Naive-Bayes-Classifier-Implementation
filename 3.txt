I was dreaming 
I was a magnificent tree
With my children as saplings
standing around me 
sharing my roots

I was dreaming 
I was a beautiful rose
With my children as buds
standing near me
on the same stalk

I was dreaming 
I was a reddish apple
with my children as blossoms
standing near me
on the same branch

I woke up
and my children were near me
So many thanks my God
