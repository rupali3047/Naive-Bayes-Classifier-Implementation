If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting
Or being lied about dont deal in lies
Or being hated dont give way to hating
And yet dont look too good nor talk too wise

If you can dreamand not make dreams your master
If you can thinkand not make thoughts your aim
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same:
If you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken
And stoop and buildem up with wornout tools

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitchandtoss
And lose and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on"

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue
Or walk with Kingsnor lose the common touch
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
If all men count with you but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds worth of distance run
Yours is the Earth and everything thats in it
Andwhich is moreyoull be a Man my son
