You may write me down in history
With your bitter twisted lies
You may tread me in the very dirt
But still like dust Ill rise

Does my sassiness upset you 
Why are you beset with gloom 
Cause I walk like Ive got oil wells
Pumping in my living room

Just like moons and like suns
With the certainty of tides
Just like hopes springing high
Still Ill rise

Did you want to see me broken 
Bowed head and lowered eyes 
Shoulders falling down like teardrops
Weakened by my soulful cries

Does my haughtiness offend you 
Dont you take it awful hard
Cause I laugh like Ive got gold mines
Diggin in my own back yard

You may shoot me with your words
You may cut me with your eyes
You may kill me with your hatefulness
But still like air Ill rise

Does my sexiness upset you 
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like Ive got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs 

Out of the huts of historys shame
I rise
Up from a past thats rooted in pain
I rise
Im a black ocean leaping and wide
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak thats wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave
I am the dream and the hope of the slave
I rise
I rise
I rise
