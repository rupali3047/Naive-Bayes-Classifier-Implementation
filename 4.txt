Pretty women wonder where my secret lies
Im not cute or built to suit a fashion models size
But when I start to tell them
They think Im telling lies
I say
Its in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips
The stride of my step
The curl of my lips
Im a woman
Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
Thats me

I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please
And to a man
The fellows stand or
Fall down on their knees
Then they swarm around me
A hive of honey bees
I say
Its the fire in my eyes
And the flash of my teeth
The swing in my waist
And the joy in my feet
Im a woman
Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
Thats me

Men themselves have wondered
What they see in me
They try so much
But they cant touch
My inner mystery
When I try to show them
They say they still cant see
I say
Its in the arch of my back
The sun of my smile
The ride of my breasts
The grace of my style
Im a woman

Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
Thats me

Now you understand
Just why my heads not bowed
I dont shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud
When you see me passing
It ought to make you proud
I say
Its in the click of my heels
The bend of my hair
the palm of my hand
The need of my care
Cause Im a woman
Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
Thats me
